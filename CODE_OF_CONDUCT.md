## Our pledge

We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Being respectful and considerate
- Accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what’s best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Harassment, insults, or discriminatory language
- Publishing others’ private information
- Trolling or personal attacks

## Enforcement

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by opening a GitHub issue and tagging it clearly as **CoC**. If the issue contains sensitive details, use GitHub’s **private security advisory** flow instead.

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards and enforcing this Code of Conduct.
